# Product-recommendation-system-Books-

This is a project sharing my implementation of a product recommendation system from end to end. The recommendation system I built is based on collaborative filtering.

The link for dataset is from Kaggle( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aksshayaravikumar/books-recommender)

**Collaborative Filtering**:

**User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: This approach recommends products to a user based on the preferences and behaviors of similar users. If users A and B have similar purchase or interaction patterns, products that user B has liked and user A hasn't yet encountered might be recommended to user A.

**Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Instead of comparing users, this approach focuses on the similarity between products. If users have interacted positively with similar items in the past, the system might recommend items based on their history of interaction.
